MIMA Simulator / Interpreter / â†¦C-Compiler
=========

[Hosted Version](https://tilosp.github.io/mima/)

A webpage to make testing/running/debugging/verifying code for the MIMA Architecture that is used in teaching at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology easier.

It will take your code as input and output compileable C-Code or a direct representation of the resulting memory map (really useful for some assignments). The feature set is believed to be complete.

A documentation of MIMA assembler can be found in [cbdev/mima/mimasm/MIMA-ASSEMBLER.txt](https://github.com/cbdevnet/mima/blob/master/mimasm/MIMA-ASSEMBLER.txt)
